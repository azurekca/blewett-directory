about: |-
  I teach electronic music production, recording engineering, and composition using Ableton Live.
  My lessons are 1-on-1 and taught online. I will occasionally host group Ableton Production “Bootcamps”.
  I offer everyone interested a free 1 hour introductory lesson to see if it’s right for them!
