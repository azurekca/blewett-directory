about: |-
  Therapeutic, recreational, and competitive equestrian vaulting

  Koot-Neigh trains year round in Blewett and Krestova, near Nelson BC, Canada. We offer a variety of classes, therapeutic services, clinics as well as performances. Our horses are specially chosen and trained, along with our coaches and athletes.

  Since 2007, Koot-Neigh's aim has been to provide learning experiences that build life skills while having fun. We have a team of certified coaches and trained horses that work together with fellow vaulters, families and support people. Through learning how to do the sport safely, with harmony and respect to the horses we believe valuable transferable skills - emotional, physical and interpersonal are developed.
